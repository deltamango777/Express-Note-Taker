# Express Note Taker

## Description

This is a note taking app designed to run in the browser and save/delete notes created by the user. 

- What was your motivation?
I wanted to make an app that helps keep notes in a very simple and direct manner. 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not \"Because it was a homework assignment.")
I built this project as both a novelty and utlity for myself. .
- What problem does it solve?
It solves organizational tasks, as it really is just a note taker. 
- What did you learn?
I learned more about the inner workings required to make something that keeps data saved and accessible enough to look through and/or delete.

## Installation

Either download the repo and follow the start script located in the package.json - or just follow the heroku link to the site. 

## Usage

Open the site and then click the notes button to be taken to the notes page. There you can leave a note title and content, of which then a save icon will appear in the top right  and you can press that to save the note. If you want to create a new note, press the "+" icon in the top right. If you want to view past notes, see and select them on the left side of the screen. And if you want to delete a note, simply press the trash icon next to one and voila. It's gone.
